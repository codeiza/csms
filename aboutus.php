                                On August 3, 1902, the General Council of the Union Obrera Democratica (UOD) proclaimed the establishment of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente. The church proposed the creation of two councils: the Executive composed of lay people and the Doctrinal composed by clergy nominated as bishops of the dioceses. Fr. Gregorio Aglipay was proposed as the head with the title of Obispo Maximo (Supreme Bishop).

Despite protests from the press, the IFI eventually gained one and a half million members, roughly one fourth or 25% of the population. The first adherents of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente included 63 residents of Navotas, priests, seminarians, faithful from various municipalities, guilds, labor groups, local committees, and expatriates.

On October 1, 1902, Pedro Brillantes took possession of his diocese and proclaimed Bacarra as his episcopal seat. He was consecrated on October 20 in accordance with the First Epistle, which justified the consecration of bishops. Bishop Gregorio Aglipay headed the signatories of the short-lived 1902 Constitution of the Philippine Independent Church.

The IFI believed that revolutions are in accordance with the will of God and that they bring far-reaching redemption and benefits that will bless many generations to come. The church issued several fundamental epistles, including the Declaration of Principles and the Fourth Fundamental Epistle, which laid down the organizational structure of the Church.

On November 2, Bishop Aglipay set aside a special commemorative service for the heroes of the Philippine Revolution and for all insurgents who died in the struggle for freedom. The Municipal Council of Lagonoy declared themselves and their parish priest as members of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, renouncing their allegiance to the Catholic Church of Rome.

Bishop Aglipay issued a manifesto on the 16th due to the rapid growth of the national Filipino Church and the necessity of an authoritative outline of its object.

                            <h1><p style="color: #1B1B1B; font-family: Palatino Linotype, Book Antiqua, Palatino, serif">Rev. Gregorio L. Aglipay</h1>
                            <p style="color: #FEFFFF; text-align: justify; font-family: Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif ;text-indent: 20px;">
                                The new year began with the withdrawal of four religious orders and the consecration of Bishop Aglipay. The IFI newspaper, La Verdad, was first published on January 21st. Aurelio Tolentino delivered speeches in February, marking the first reference to the IFI as one that emerged from the ashes of the revolution. Bishop Aglipay submitted royal and papal decrees stating that the Cathedral of Manila and its properties belonged to the Spanish government and should be the property of the US insular government.

The Sixth and last Fundamental Epistle was issued on August 17, emphasizing the importance of liberty and the right to think freely. The IFI formally canonized four Filipino heroes, Rizal, Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, but did not venerate them. The Church published La Iglesia Filipina Independiente Revista Catolica (LIFIRC) on October 11, 1904.

On October 28, the IFI adopted the Doctrina y Reglas Constitucionales (DRC), which replaced the Fundamental Epistles as the doctrinal foundation and governing rules until 1947. On August 5, 1947, the IFI adopted a new Constitution, Canons, and Declaration of Faith and Articles of Religion.

In 1904, the Lecturas de Cuaresma series began serializing in La Iglesia Filipina Independiente: Revista Catolica, stating that the IFI is the most rationalistic religion based on the Bible. Bishop Aglipay accepted an invitation to attend the Provincial Synod of Manila in 1904, but expressed gratitude for the conciliatory gesture.

On July 24, 1905, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 1376 to resolve the controversy between the Roman Catholic Church and the Philippine Independent Church. The Supreme Court ordered the IFI to return all properties it had seized and occupied from the Roman Catholic Church, which was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 1909.
